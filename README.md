### What's a 501(c)(3) ?

It's an [IRS term](https://www.irs.gov/Charities-\&-Non-Profits/Charitable-Organizations/Exemption-Requirements-Section-501\(c\)\(3\)-Organizations) for one type of tax exemption organizations. 

### 501(c)(3) Organizations Enjoy Free or Deep-discounted IT Products or Services

Many corporations give special discounts to 501(c)(3) organization, or even provide free stuff to them. Among those:

### Paypal Giving Fund

[Paypal Giving Fund](https://www.paypal.com/givingfund/), formerly MissionFish, generously covers your organization's transaction fees for donations going through them.
